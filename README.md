# Network Trafic Viewer

---

This Python script let you visualise your network trafic usage, seeing which IP uses the most data.

You also can lock them out of internet (using an ARP poison attack)

---

## Usage

Install requirements :

    python3 python3-pip

using your package manager (for example `apt-get`)

Then, run `setup.sh`

When you installed everything, you are ready to run the script :

    ./run.sh

Note: Passivly capturing packets isn't (to my knowledge) illegal, but MItM (represended in this tool as "Locking") it definitly.

Use this tool on your own network, or with admin rights

---

Enjoy and stay legal ;-)
